# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: The difference between a parameter and an argument is that a parameter is the name listed in the functions definition. The parameter is the placeholder essentially. An argument on the other hand is the actual value that's passed to the function.

  Researched answer: Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function. Parameters are initially set to the values of the arguments supplied, with no attempt to substitute or correlate them with each other.


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The predefined parameters are the function definition, the array parameter and the index parameter. The index parameter is considered optional.

  Researched answer: The map() method in JavaScript creates an array by calling a specific function on each element present in the parent array. It is a non-mutating method. This method accepts two parameters function which has three parameters within it (currentValue, index, arr) and return value.


3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: The filter method differs from the map method. Maps make a new array by changing each item in an array individually and filters make a new array by removing items that don't belong.

  Researched answer: A map and a filter are two different types of data structures. The primary difference between the two is the return of values. A map will always have a representation for elements in the list. A filter will filter out the only elements that will meet the conditions in the function.


4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function differs from a method because a function executes a specific task while a method provides a set of instructions that pertain to a specific object.

  Researched answer: A method is a code that can be called by the name of its object and its method name using dot notation or square bracket notation. A function can pass the data that is operated and may return the data, depending on what type of data is being passed.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Object destructuring is a useful feature to extract properties from objects and bind them to variables. Object destructuring can extract multiple properties in one statement. It can access properties from nested objects, and can set a default value if an object doesn't have a particular property.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting in JavaScript is the process of moving declarations to the top so that you can use them before thy're declared.

  Researched answer: JavaScript Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared. It is the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability. Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more. Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class.

2. React: React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's 'V' in MVC. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application.

3. React state: The state is a built-in property of a React component. A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.

4. React lifecycle methods: Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. These are Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

5. DOM: The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. This guide will look at how the DOM represents an HTML document in memory and how to use it to create web content and applications.
